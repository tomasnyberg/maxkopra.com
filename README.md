## This is a (WIP) blog site I am building for my friend, Max Kopra. Available at maxkopra.com

I have deployed the site through Vercel, currently using only next.js for development to avoid unnecessary overhead. 
___

The entire app is statically generated with NextJS getStaticProps/getStaticPaths features, leading to very fast load times and good SEO.
